Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two On Semiconductor SS16 rectifier for failure analysis. The [On](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/308/SS16-1301707.pdf) Semiconductor SS16 Schottky Rectifier features glass-passivated junctions and a high-current capacity. Their applications include low voltage, high-frequency inverters, freewheeling, and polarity protection. Their storage temperature range is between -65 and 150 Degrees Celsius and the operating junction temperature is between -65 and 125 Degrees Celsius. Along with the two failed rectifiers, several good devices were also supplied for comparison. The goal was to determine why the On Semiconductor SS16 Schottky rectifiers were failing.

Upon receiving the device, we immediately began failure analysis. There was no external damage to any of the diodes provided. The diodes were removed from the PCBs and tested on a curve tracer. A [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_curve_tracer) tracer works by applying voltage to two terminals of the device under test, measuring the amount of the current that the device permits to flow at a corresponding voltage. The curve trace revealed both failed devices were shorted. X-rays were taken, and they revealed some voiding in the solder. The parts were then decapsulated. There was considerable voiding in the solder to lead frame attachments. The copper and solder were removed to expose the failure site, which was directly over the guard ring. The failure analysis yielded some familiar results suggesting an avalanche breakdown on both diodes.
