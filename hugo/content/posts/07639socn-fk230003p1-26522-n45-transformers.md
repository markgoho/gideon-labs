Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two07639SOCN FK230003P1 26522-N45 transformers for electronic failure analysis. Transformers are electrical devices typically used to transfer energy between two or more circuits using electromagnetic induction. Electromagnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force across a conductor when it is exposed to a varying magnetic field. Using [Faraday's Law](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/farlaw.html) with high magnetic permeability core properties, transformers can efficiently change AC voltages from one voltage level to another within a given power network. One transformer had a lower expected resistance on pins 4-6 and the other had a resistance changing when the temperature was elevated. The goal was to perform failure analysis on these transformers.

To determine the cause of the failure, several steps were undertaken. The 07639SOCN FK230003P1 26522-N45Â transformers were housed in a fiberglass resin box, which was then filled with an epoxy over the polyimide coated magnet wires. The sides of the transformers were slightly bulging. The sides were removed, the wires exposed, and a variety of electrical tests were conducted. The epoxy was removed and the magnet wire was inspected, there were no defects in the epoxy nor cracks in the magnet wire. After the stripping, the probe penetrated the film very easily. Leakage across the adjacent turns is causing the resistance to decrease. The failure was the result of two possibilities: the wire coating degraded because of hydrolytic cleavage or the polyimide tape not being adequately applied over the different inductors.
