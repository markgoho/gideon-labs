Gideon Analytical Laboratories received twoST Microelectronics BTA06-600B and two Little fuse Q6006L5 triacs in TO-220AB packages. Inspection of the die for microcracking was requested.

We were happy to fulfill our client's request. There were no mechanical marks on either device and the lead frame was tin-plated. The Triacs were electronically tested on a curve tracer. A [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_curve_tracer) tracer is a specialized piece of electronic test equipment used to analyze the characteristics of discrete semiconductor devices such as diodes,transistors, and thyristors. Based on an oscilloscope, the device also contains voltage and current sources that can be used to stimulate the device under test. The curve trace results revealed all four triacs were in working order. Devices were ten decapsulated and each die perimeter visually inspected. All dies were inspected for cracks. On the ST devices, sides of one of the die were not perfectly cut with the dicing saw, but no cracks were observed. Of the Little fuse devices, one device had no defects at all. The other device had silicon pieces plucked from the die, small cracking, and the inevitability of that crack propagating.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories is a flexible and creative failure analysis laboratory. We work with our clients to analyze specific things at their request. We are available for consultation. We listen to our clients' concerns and comments, and we work with them to create a specific plan for analysis. We always have the best interest of our clients in mind. If your company is in need of expert failure electronic failure analysis performed accurately and in a timely fashion, do not hesitate to contact us.
