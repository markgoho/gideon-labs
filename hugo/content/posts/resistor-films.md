Gideon Analytical Laboratories received several amplifier units were supplied to ascertain the difference between a new vintage resistor, which failed, and the older one, which functioned normally. A resistor is a passive electrical component that enacts electrical resistance in a circuit. These resistors were measured at 22 ohms.

Failure analysis was performed on the resistors. It was not known if the resistors were from the same vendor or whether the power dissipation of the thick film was the same. A cross-section analysis revealed no differences in the alumina used for the substrate or construction of the film on the substrate. Since no differences were revealed during the cross-section, [SEM-EDS](/analytical-services/scanning-electron-microscopy/) analysis was performed. EDS analysis revealed some significant differences in the old and new resistors; the peaks were clearly different in the old resistor. Titanium and chromium were present and silver and ruthenium were absent. The film composition determines the resistance values and the surge current the film can tolerate.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories has the resources, expertise, and experience to help numerous companies in the electronics industry. With failure analysis provided byGideon Analytical Laboratories, companies in the electronics industry can obtain accurate and understandable reasons for why their components fail. Knowing this type of information can save time, money, and give companies peace of mind.
