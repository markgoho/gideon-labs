Gideon Analytical Laboratories received 10 parts each of Everlight and Nichia, respectively, LED components to on which to perform a moisture ingress comparison. An LED (light-emitting diode) is a semiconductor light source that uses an anode, a cathode, and a die to direct electrons to release energy in the form of protons.  A moisture ingress test is to determine the protection and susceptibility level of a device to moisture. Moisture ingress tests are conducted for all kinds of electronics equipment. The devices tested were an Everlight  67-23SDRSUGSUBC/TR8 and a Nichia NSCM315CT. These experiments were run to determine if these LEDs were compatible with their own production process, and then also to compare them with each other in their ability to resist moisture.

The moisture ingress test was conducted using Zyglo, which will glow green if ingress occurs inside of the device. Tests were conducted simulating several different situations. Devices were tested at a range of temperatures, pressures, and material ingresses. It was found that the Everlight 67-23SDRSUGSUBC/TR8was superior to the NichiaNSCM315CT in moisture resistance.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories offers to provide accurate and thorough failure analysis. In addition, however, Gideon Analytical Laboratories offers a wide variety of scientific testing using state of the art analytical equipment.
