Gideon Analytical Laboratories received one printed circuit board (PCB) with an open in the plated through hole (PTH). A printed circuit board mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate.  Advanced PCBs may contain components - capacitors, resistors or active devices - embedded in the substrate. PCBs are used in all but the simplest electronic products. Plated through holes are a type of through-hole technology, which refers to the mounting scheme used for electronic components that involve the use of leads on the components that are inserted into holes drilled in PCBs and soldered to pads on the opposite side either by manual assembly or by the use of automated insertion mount machines. The goal was to determine whether or not contamination caused the open in the via.

Component failure analysis ensued. The PTH has only connected to the first and fourth layer; the via tested open. There was a void in the copper plating. The plating void was around the entire PTH. The rest of the barrel showed thinness and plating irregularities. The open occurred where there was an inconsistency in the plating. There was no contamination or corrosion found in the via.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories is a worldwide leader in electronic component failure analysis. We face the tough problems head-on, and we solve them. If you are having contamination issues, call Gideon Analytical Laboratories for analysis. If you have any electronics problems in design, production, or application, give Gideon Analytical Laboratories call.
