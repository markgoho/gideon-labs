Gideon Analytical Laboratories received six United Chemi-Con KMG series 400V 22uF 6U capacitors for the specific purpose of determining whether or not they had the presence of chlorides.

The analysis was performed using SEM-EDS. The SEM-EDS system gave elemental analysis in relation to the intensity of the element at a specific wavelength or energy level (Kev). [SEM-EDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy) is an analytical technique used for the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a sample. It relies on an interaction of some source of X-ray excitation and a sample. Its characterization capabilities are due in large part to the fundamental principle that each element has a unique atomic structure allowing a unique set of peaks on its electromagnetic emission spectrum.The[electron-volt](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt) is used to measure energy. It is defined as the amount of energy an electron gains after being accelerated by 1 volt of electricity.

The chloride analysis yielded some interesting results. The anode terminal comprising the lead, fillet, shank, and tab was removed from each capacitor. The fillet, shank, and tab were examined using SEM-EDS. No chlorides were found on any of the six anode leads examined. There were no halogens or any foreign elements in any of the anode leads on theUnited Chemi-Con KMG series 400V 22uF 6U capacitors. They were all acceptable.

Why wait until your products fail to have them analyzed? Gideon Analytical Laboratories can help you preemptively deal with failures. Do you suspect there might be contamination of a component? Let us check! Do you suspect your products are susceptible to moisture? Let us check! You can help to prevent failures before they happen by using Gideon Analytical Laboratories to make sure things are reliable. Be proactive, not reactive. But if and when parts fail, be reactive too. Either way, Gideon Analytical Laboratories is here when you need us. Give us a call today.
