Gideon Analytical Laboratories received eighteen digital signal processors (DSPs) for failure analysis. A DSP is a microprocessor architecturally designed to mathematically modify or improve a signal. DSPs are used in a variety of applications, including audio and speech signal processing or and sonar and radar signal processing. The goal in digital signal processing is to convert real-world analog signals into digital signals. Gideon Analytical Laboratories performed failure analysis on the DSPs.

Of the eighteen DSPs examined, only three failed due to ESD/EOS. These failures were cleaned and etched, which revealed they had been encapsulated in the UV urethane conformal coating. The aluminum had reflowed under the polyimide die coat. There was a disruption on one of the rails; a deposit of aluminumÂ was visible. The cause of these failures was electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD damage caused gate oxide damage, which resulted in latent failures.

Failure analysis provided by Gideon Analytical Laboratories can save electronics companies time and money. By identifying the origins of failures, companies can rest assured they will have the information they need to correct any problems and make sure their components are reliable.
