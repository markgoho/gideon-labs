Gideon Analytical Laboratories received several Multi-Layered Ceramic Capacitors that had failed and two good MLCCs for comparison. The failure was occurring during the development cycle and it was thought this might be an issue with the manufacturing process. Multilayer ceramic capacitors are fixed value capacitors in which ceramic the material acting as the dielectric. It is made up of two or more alternating layers of ceramic and a metal layer acting as the electrodes. There are various types of materials that could function as the dielectric in a capacitor, for example, glass, porcelain, paper, or mica.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories, as usual, rose to the occasion with excellent electronic failure analysis. The MLCCs were electrically tested. The capacitor would not charge types of cracks. There was delamination, and there were thermal and knit line cracks. The thermal cracks extended to the outside of the capacitor where the ceramic cracked and broke off to alleviate the internal heat stress produced during the shorting.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories single goal is to diagnose problems with electronics. In this case, we took a look at the manufacturing process. We deal with all phases possible electronic failures. We can solve problems in the design, manufacture, or application in the field. It doesn't really matter what the problem is; if it involves electronics, Gideon Analytical Laboratories is the place to contact. We will take care of you and your business. We take the utmost care to give you immediate and accurate feedback to help you remedy the problem. Use any of your currently working electronic devices to call or email us today.
