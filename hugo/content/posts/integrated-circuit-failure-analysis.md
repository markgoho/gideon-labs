Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two integrated circuits for failure analysis. [Integrated](http://http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289645/integrated-circuit-IC) circuits (ICs) are an assembly of electronic components, fabricated as a single unit, in which miniaturized active devices (like transistors and diodes) and passive devices (like capacitors and resistors) and their interconnections are built upon a thin substrate of semiconductor material. One was a Texas Instruments 5962-9861201QXA and the other was a Vishay 5962-9562301Q3A. The Texas Instruments 5962-9861201QXA was a DSP fixed-point 16-Bit 40MHz 20MIPS 132-Pin CFPAK. The Vishay 5962-9562301Q3A analog switch multiplexer was a single 16:1 28-Pin LCC with a 44V maximum supply voltage rating. The goal was to determine why these two integrated circuits were failing.

Integrated circuit failure analysis ensued. First, the ICs were electrically tested. On the Texas Instruments 5962-9861201QXA, one of the pins tested open and two of the pins were partially melted on the wire bond pad. The melted were an indication of electrical overstress (EOS). EOS had completely opened the trace left trace line of one of the pins. On the Vishay 5962-9562301Q3A,  one of the pins had EOS damage near the pad and both of its trace lines had completely melted. On both of these integrated circuits, there was EOS on various pins, which caused a malfunction. EOS  usually results in increased localized temperatures leading to melting or vaporizing metallization layers, melting the semiconductor or changing structures. Diffusion and electromigration tend to be accelerated by high temperatures, shortening the lifetime of the device.
