Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two newly designed ST Microelectronics ASC T6108 Triacs in a [TO-220AB](https://www.vishay.com/docs/71195/to220ab.pdf) package. A [TRIAC](http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/semicond/triac/what-is-a-triac-basics-tutorial.php) is a three terminal semiconductor device for controlling current.Its formal name is bidirectional triode thyristor or bilateral triode thyristor. A thyristor is analogous to a relay in that a small voltage and current can control a much larger voltage and current. The goal was to determine if these ASC T6108 Triacs were reliable.

Electronic failure analysis was performed on the ASC T6108 Triacs. There were no mechanical marks on the units. The Triac was decapsulated. The die was in PNPN vertical diffusion on a monolithic silicon chip. Passivation integrity was tested; the passivation was very robust. Etching exposed the underlying diffusions; all of the guard rings and diffusions were properly protected by silicon dioxide. All the geometries for the die layout had no anomalies in the pattern or registration. There were no dicing anomalies. There were no chatter marks on the Kerf. The "OUT" connection was very secured. This was a reliable product.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories does not just diagnose electronic failures when things go awry. We can also validate when products are functioning properly and reliably. If you are a manufacturer and have a redesigned product, let us test it for reliability! If you want to know if your product will withstand certain conditions, let us test it for you! If your company has failures in design, manufacture, or design, let us help you. Give Gideon Analytical Laboratories a call today.
