Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two image sensors with high impedance on the connector between pins 4 and 5, measuring 10 KHz. An image sensor or imaging sensor is a sensor that detects and conveys the information that constitutes an image. It does so by converting the variable attenuation of light waves (as they pass through or reflect off objects) into signals, small bursts of current that convey the information. The waves can be light or other electromagnetic radiation. Image sensors are used in electronic imaging devices of both analog and digital types, which include digital cameras, camera modules, medical imaging equipment, night vision equipment such as thermal imaging devices, radar, sonar, and others. kHz stands for kilohertz (10³ Hz). Hertz is the unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one cycle per second.It is named for Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves. The goal was to analyze these sensors and identify the cause of increasing resistance.

Failure analysis was conducted on the two sensors. First, the sensors were disassembled. A cable held the elastomer, which made contact with the gold-plated pad and interfaced to a receiving printed circuit board (PCB). Both sensors were failing at 10 kHz and giving out resistance readings of 7 and 4.3 Ohms, respectively. SEM-EDS analysis on the elastomer proved it to be free from contamination. Rubber was cut to expose the gold pad and that pad analyzed using SEM-EDS to identify any elements present. There were two foreign elements found on the gold pads. Also, stains were visible to the eye on the gold pads. These stains were analyzed using FTIR. The analysis yielded some surprising results, including the presence of nickel oxide (Ni2O3) and some perchlorate salt (NaClO4). This problem is a correctable problem.
