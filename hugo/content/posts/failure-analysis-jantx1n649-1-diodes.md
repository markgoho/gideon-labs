Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two [Microsemi](http://http://www.microsemi.com/existing-parts/parts/6571?catid=633) JanTX1N649-1 diodes for electronic failure analysis. A [diode](http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode) is a two-terminal electronic component with asymmetric conductance. It has low resistance to current flow in one direction, and high resistance in the other direction. There are various kinds of diodes, including vacuum tube diodes and solid state diodes. The most used and ubiquitous diode is the semiconductor. TheÂ JanTX1N649-1 is a voltage regulator diode is ideal for high-reliability applications where a failure cannot be tolerated. They are 1.5-watt voltage regulators that are hermetically sealed with a void-less glass construction using an internal metallurgical bond.

Failure analysis was conducted on theJanTX1N649-1 diodes. Both diodes tested dead short. The external glass had no mechanical damage. The package was removed to expose the diode die. The glass was removed, and the silicon rectifier simply fell apart. The silicon in both cases had completely lost shape due to excessive power and extreme conditions (temperature) beyond the capability of the die. The die had no resemblance of its former state. Excessive power through the diode caused a catastrophic failure.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories is one of the premier failure analysis laboratories in the world. Companies from all over the world have chose to let Gideon Analytical Laboratories help them solve problems with their products. Whether the problem is a design flaw, error in production, or failure in the field, we know how to get the job done. Save time and money. Fix your products and ensure their reliability.
