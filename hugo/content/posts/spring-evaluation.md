Gideon Analytical Laboratories received several failed and several good Shanghai Daido springs for evaluation. Shanghai Daido SP Co makes four types of springs: compression, heavy load, tension, and torsion. Gideon Analytical Laboratories was altered to possible contamination on the failed springs. The goal was to see why these springs were failing.

Failure analysis ensued. [SEM-EDS](/analytical-services/scanning-electron-microscopy/) analysis was first utilized to ascertain the elements present within the springs. Micrographs of the first spring pictured a low energy granular type structure with a shiny surface. There were areas that were pitted, and in other areas, severe dissolution of the metal. EDS spectra revealed the presence of chlorides within the nickel and chromium exterior. Micrographs of another spring revealed the decreased presence of nickel. The fourth spring was a catastrophic failure; it had large pits and corrosion was obvious. EDS spectra revealed the presence of chlorides. In summary, pitting was observed on five of the springs, and chlorides were present on these five springs. Corrosion caused cracking, and cracking caused failure.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories has been conducting electronic failure analysis on electronic components for over two decades. With our knowledge, equipment, and dedication, there is almost no problem we cannot solve. We are the problem solvers of the electronic industry. Electronic failure analysis is what we do, and we are here to help. If you have aÂ problem with any electrical devices, from production to application in the field, call Gideon Analytical Laboratories.
