Gideon Analytical Labs received one failed relay with one good one for comparison. The failed relay was intermittent @ 2 KHz.

A reed relay is a switch that uses an electromagnet to control the turning off or on within a circuit. The contacts are of magnetic material and the electromagnet acts directly on them without requiring an armature to move them. Sealed in a long, narrow glass tube, the contacts are protected from corrosionÂ and are usually plated with silver, which has very low resistivity but is prone to corrosion when exposed, rather than corrosion-resistant but more resistive gold as used in the exposed contacts of high-quality relays. Multiple reed switches can be inserted into a single bobbin and actuate simultaneously. The glass tube is wrapped in copper windings and closes the switch with an inductive action when the copper is energized.

The coil resistance was 151.7 ohms, the turn-on voltage was 1.8V, and the release was 1.1 V. The inductance was 13 mH at 5VDC. The part was decapsulated to reveal the structure and solder joints. Upon internal inspection, it was determined that several of the solder joints were cracked, lifting and cold.

Gideon Analytical Labs can determine a problem fast saving the expense in production, rework, improving customer satisfaction and quality control, product failure, and long-term reliability failures from hitting the field.
