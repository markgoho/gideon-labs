Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two Sunon Maglev MC35101V2-000U-G99 12V fans which did not operate. Along with the nonoperational fans, two functional fans were also sent to us for comparison. The [Sunon](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Sunon/MC35101V2-000U-G99?qs=XtX6y9BSeMjdsLrP4W3AFQ%3D%3D) Maglev MC35101V2-000U-G99 12V fan is an axial DC fan, with a speed of 7500 RPM and airflow of 6.5 CFM. An axial fan is a type of fan that causes gas to flow through it in an axial direction, parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. The flow is axial at entry and exit. The fan is designed to produce a pressure difference, and hence force, to cause a flow through the fan. Our goal was to determine why the Sunon Maglev MC35101V2-000U-G99 12V fans were failing.

Failure analysis was conducted on the Sunon Maglev MC35101V2-000U-G99 12V fans. The first thing we noticed was the fan stalled or stuttered upon connecting to 12V. The fans were electrically tested and then taken apart to expose the electronics and coil. Components on the PCB inside the fan were tested, which included the Hall Sensor IC, the MLCC, and others. X-rays were taken of the PCB, but no defects were found. The Hall Sensor was x-rayed and decapsulated. We then examined the Hall Senor until the failure site was located. On both failed PCBs on the Sunon Maglev MC35101V2-000U-G99 12V fans, there was heat damage. This was not a manufacturing issue. The reason why these fans failed was overvoltage on the Hall Sensor IC.

With pinpoint precision and in a timely manner, Gideon Analytical Laboratories, once again, completed the job. When it comes to failure analysis, the choice is clear. One analytical laboratory stands above the competition because of our years of experience, background in chemistry and electrical engineering, and state of the art analytical equipment. If you are experiencing electronic failures, call Gideon Analytical Laboratories today.
