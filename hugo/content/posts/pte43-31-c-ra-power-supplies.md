Gideon Analytical Laboratories received three PTE43-31-C-RA power supplies, two were failed and the other was a working device for comparison. Power supplies are devices that supply electrical power to an electrical load. Some power supplies convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) for use in a variety of electronics. Typically, a computer needs a power supply that will convert 120 Volt AC power oscillating at 60 Hertz (Hz). Power supplies are vital to most electronic endeavors, like electrical components in machines, process automation, or for power generation. OnePTE43-31-C-RA power supply had a problem with the 5 volt (V) output line; it was going below the toleration limit of the processor and shutting down. Gideon Analytical Laboratories was determined to find the reason for this failure.

The failure analysis conducted by Gideon Analytical Laboratories was thorough and netted some interesting results. The power supply was electrically tested for things like voltage and resistance. It was noted that there was a shift in voltage on a specific area of the connector plugging directly into the printed circuit board (PCB). Additional electrical testing on the other power supply confirmed that indeed, the failure was due to the connection between the connector and the PCB rather than the ability of theÂ PTE43-31-C-RA power supply to produce and maintain a steady voltage output. SEM-EDS metallurgy analysis was also performed on the PCB connector. The ROHS compliant connectors had a tin plating on a nickel strike over brass (copper/zinc). SEM-EDS analysis revealed that connectors are susceptible to oxidation in humid environments. These PTE-43-31-C-RA had some issues that affect reliability.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories has the knowledge, experience, and research equipment to get failure analysis work done correctly and in a timely fashion. If you are having problems with any types of electrical equipment, whether it be in the manufacturing process or in the application process, let Gideon Analytical Laboratories help you solve your problems. It is our goal to help electronics companies better navigate the business world with the peace of mind that come with knowing exactly why problems occur, and how to fix them.
