Gideon Analytical Labs received contaminated rubber seals which prevented the rubber from functioning correctly.

The colorless liquid gave the spectra in Figure 1. This is very similar and matches very well with a spectrum of N-(heptyl-nonyl-undecyl) phthalate, which is shown in Figure 2. This is generically known as a “phthalate ester” which is a liquid similar in appearance to vegetable oil. Phthalates are used primarily in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride products and used as a plasticizer to create softness and flexibility.

The black rubbery seal shows absorptions due to the phthalate ester is seen in Figure 1 containing butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer. The tilted baseline indicates the presence of an IR scattering material, probably carbon. The specimen was further rinsed and extracted to remove the phthalate ester shows the absorptions due to butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer. A reference spectrum of butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer rubber. This copolymer is commonly called Buna-N.

Gideon Analytical Labs can save time and money for your company by identifying the contaminate immediately.
