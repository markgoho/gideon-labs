Gideon Analytical Analytical Laboratories received one [On](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/76304.pdf) Semi MC14070BG CMOS SSI  in a SOEIAJ-14 package, with the 15V supply line pulled down to 3.5V. The MC14070B quad exclusive OR gate and the MC14077B quad exclusive NOR gates are constructed with MOS P−channel and N−channel enhancement mode devices in a single monolithic structure. These complementary MOS logic gates find primary use where low power dissipation and/or high noise immunity is desired. The [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS) is a Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor, which is a technology for constructing integrated circuits. CMOS technology is used in microprocessors, microcontrollers, static RAM, and other digital logic circuits. CMOS technology is also used for several analog circuits such as image sensors (CMOS sensor), data converters, and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication. The goal was to determine why the On Semi MC14070BG CMOS SSI was failing.

Failure analysis ensued. TheOn Semi MC14070BG CMOS SSI was decapsulated. The zener protection between the ground and supply voltage remained intact, however, there were signs of a resistance short between ground and supply voltage. The failure site was on the Vdd line. All indications point to excessive voltage as the cause of this failure.
