Gideon Analytical Laboratories received to MR16 sockets for a comparison between the current model and a new candidate. The MR16s are a type of bi-pin lamp fitting. Bi-pin lamp fittings are for use in incandescent (especially halogen) and some fluorescent lights. Gideon Analytical Laboratories not only helps companies identify the causes of failures in the manufacturing process and the field but in this case, can help identify positives and negatives about a type of design or types of materials.

The structures of both these sockets were identical. The ground screw tightens into a brass socket, which holds a ground band on the outside of the porcelain. The band was, in both cases (old and new), made out of a nickel-plated iron manganese core. An MR16 socket is pictured below, at left.

Cross-sectioning of the MR16 revealed some significant differences between the old and new designs and materials. The clip on the old socket was made of nickel-coated brass. This metallurgy combination is softer than copper and with the nickel coating; the contact frame is more corrosive resistant than the new socket metallurgy. The pull strength was two times better on the old MR16 socket than the new MR16 socket. The old MR16 socket joint is pictured below, at right. The springs in both sockets were examined to see what type of metallurgy would cause a large difference in pull force.

The old spring is made of stainless steel and had a larger helical wind, which provides a greater force on the spring. This spring is more corrosive resistant than the new socket. The old socket had a bigger spring, larger contact-clip, and materials used are better for longer life and reliability compared to the new socket. Gideon Analytical Laboratories can provide information that helps electronics companies save time and money.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories can help eliminate electronic component problems in manufacture, design, or in the field. We can solve plating problems as well as corrosion problems all at reasonable prices.
