Gideon Analytical Labs examined the extrusion marks on the tungsten IC probes wires versusÂ a Monel K500 IC probes via [SEM](/analytical-services/scanning-electron-microscopy/). MONEL K500 is a nickel-copper alloy, precipitation hardenable through additions of aluminum and titanium. MONEL K500 retains the excellent corrosion resistant characteristics of 400 and has enhanced strength and hardness after precipitation hardening when compared with 400. Alloy K500 has approximately three (3) times the yield strength and double the tensile strength when compared with 400. MONEL K500 can be further strengthened by cold working before the precipitation hardening.

The Monel has forming stress marks on the bend. The micro-etchants used to form the taper are different for tungsten and Monel. These probes are about 3-4 inches long and the tip is about 10um.

Gideon Analytical Labs performs routine analysis also. Call us with your routine QC inspection or call us with any failure analysis.
