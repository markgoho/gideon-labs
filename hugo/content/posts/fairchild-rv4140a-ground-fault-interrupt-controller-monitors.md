Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two [Fairchild](http://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/54473/FAIRCHILD/RV4140A.html) RV4140A Ground Fault Interrupt Controller/Monitors in eight-pin SOIC packages. The Fairchild RV4140A is low power controller for AC outlet appliance leakage circuit interrupters. These devices detect hazardous current paths to ground such as an appliance falling into water. The interrupter then opens the circuit before a harmful or lethal shock occurs. A [SOIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Outline_Integrated_Circuit) package is a surface-mounted integrated circuit (IC) package which occupies an area about 30 to 50 % less than an equivalent dual in-line package (DIP), with a typical thickness that is 70 % less. They are generally available in the same pin-outs as their counterpart DIP ICs. The impedance from pins 8 to 4 was low on both devices. The goal was to determine why.

Electronic failure analysis ensued. Each device was electrically tested to verify the failures. One device measured 2.86K ohms and the other 346 ohms. Devices were decapsulated. They were then measured with a curve tracer. Under a microscope, failure sights were obvious. This was a case of ESD. [Electrostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge) Discharge is the sudden flow of electricity between two electrically charged objects caused by contact, an electrical short, or dielectric breakdown. A buildup of static electricity can be caused by tribocharging or by electrostatic induction.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories rose to this challenge like a helium balloon in a room full of nitrogen. We are one of the preeminent electronic failure analysis laboratories in the world. We have helped electronics companies from all corners of the earth, as well as all over the United States. If your company has electronic failures and you want them solved, give Gideon Analytical Laboratories a call today.
