Gideon Analytical Laboratories received four Vishay CRCW2512220RJNEG thick film chip resistors to be analyzed. [Thick film](http://www.resistorguide.com/thin-and-thick-film/) resistors are the most used resistors in electrical and electronic devices. The resistive material is a special paste with a mixture of a binder, a carrier, and the metal oxides to be deposited. These [Vishay CRCW2512220RJNEG](https://www.vishay.com/docs/20035/dcrcwe3.pdf) resistors thick film chip resistors feature stability at different environmental conditions and 2mm pitch packaging option for 0603 sizes. Typical applications for these chip resistors include automotive, telecommunications, and industrial. Its resistance range is 1 and 10 ohms. All of the Vishay CRCW2512220RJNEG thick film chip resistors tested open. The goal was to try to diagnose these failures.

Electronic failure analysis ensued. All of the resistors had arrived still mounted on the PCBs. On the first sample, the laser scribe mark traversed the alumina about half and in a straight line, so several eruptions were analyzed using SEM-EDS. The top glaze on the first sample was removed, and there was extensive damage under the glass scratch protection. This ended up being the case for all four Vishay CRCW2512220RJNEG thick film chip resistors. We used SEM-EDS analysis on all four samples to determine what the contamination was. For three of the four samples, the presence of chlorides was detected. This issue was related to the manufacturing process.

Another day, another problem solved by Gideon Analytical Laboratories. We have proven methods by which we solve electrical problems. We do the research. We present you all of the gathered evidence and then we make a conclusion. We offer objective, accurate, candid explanations of why electrical problems are happening. Unlike a compromised hermetic seal, we have integrity. Whether your company is large or small; wherever you are in the world, we are the analytical laboratory to choose.
