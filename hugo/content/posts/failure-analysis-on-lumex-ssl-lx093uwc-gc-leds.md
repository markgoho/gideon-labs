Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two LUMEX SSL-LX093UWC/Gc LEDs for failure analysis. A LED (Light Emitting Diode), is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. LEDs can be used in many different applications. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. Some of the [more](https://inhabitat.com/7-weird-and-wonderful-uses-for-led-lighting-technology/) creative uses include creating an LED virtual sky, LED bionic contact lenses, and LED wallpaper. Both of the LUMEX SSL-LX093UWC/Gc LEDs were intermittent; one was mounted to a PCB and the other was loose. The goal was to determine the cause of these failing LEDs.

Failure analysis was conducted on the LEDs. First, they were electrically tested. Testing confirmed that they were both intermittent, but neither were intermittent at current below 1ma. X-rays were taken to reveal any anomalies within the PMM (Polymethyl methacrylate) encapsulating the material. Both LEDs were decapsulated, and micrographs were taken of problem areas. The loose LED showed a lack of wetted solder. The other LED that was mounted to the PCB had wire interconnectivity issues involving the ball bond. These failing LUMEX SSL-LX093UWC/Gc LEDs were not related to power abuse, but suspect manufacturing techniques.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories is one of the preeminent electronic failure analysis laboratories in the entire world. It can be difficult to determine why a device is failing. Is the device perfectly fine but its usage causing the problem? Is the device itself problematic because of manufacturing errors? There are so many different reasons a device might fail, but you are not alone in your quest for answers. With state of the art technology and decades of experience in the field, we have what it takes to solve your electrical problems. Give Gideon Analytical Laboratories a call today.
