Gideon Analytical Laboratories received three different vendor 100-ohm resistors, made by Vishay, RCD, and Stackpole, respectively. The two Stackpole resistors were open. A [resistoris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor) a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. Our goal was to test the functionality the Vishay, RCD, and Stackpole resistors, and if any were failing, determine the cause of the failure.

Failure analysis ensued. The Stackpole resistor measured in the gigaohm range, which indicated an open line. X-rays were taken of these failed devices. They were then decapsulated and the potting materials carefully removed. The wire was now clearly visible, and it showed marks of abrasion. In fact, one of the wires had actually popped off. The Vishay and RCD resistors were far better. There were no abrasion marks on either of them, and their wire sizing was slightly larger than the Stackpole resistor. The conclusion we reached was that the issue with the Stackpole 100-ohm resistor was one related to manufacturing.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories is here when you need us most. If your product is failing, it could be anyone (or maybe more) of numerous possibilities. Is it your production process? Is it someone elses production process? Is it how the product is being used? Is it a part made by a vendor? Is it a part made by a vendor's vendor? Solving electrical problems might appear daunting, but we can simultaneously give you relief and confidence. Let us take care of the problem. Contact us with any electrical problems and see how we can help you. Give Gideon Analytical Laboratories a call today.
