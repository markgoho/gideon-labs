Gideon Analytical Labs received two linear adjustable monolithic silicon 5962-89981 adjustable positive regulators both with no measurable output for failure analysis. A third device was sent with a questionable output. This is a three terminal positive adjustable voltage regulator designed to provide 1.5A with higher efficiency than conventional voltage regulators. The device is designed to operate to 1 Volt input to output differential and the dropout voltage is specified as a function of load current. The device is in a TO-257 hermetic package where Military applications require small size and high reliability.

It was found examining the integrated circuit that a current surge came in pin 1 (the input) and destroyed several trace lines to the adjustable leg of the device. The adjustable leg is controlled by a 5k potentiometer which showed no effect in the analysis.

Gideon Analytical Labs performs analysis for the military, aerospace, and wall street. Each of these demands the highest quality and reliable results which Gideon gives in every report. Call the " Problem Solvers of the Electronic Industry". Call Gideon. 845-255-5356
