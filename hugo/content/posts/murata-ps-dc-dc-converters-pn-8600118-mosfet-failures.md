Gideon Analytical Laboratories received 8Murata Ps DC-DC converters (pn 8600118) with suspected MOSFET failures. A [DC-DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC-to-DC_converter) converter is an electronic circuit or electromechanical device that converts a source of direct current (DC) from one voltage level to another. It is a type of electric power converter. Power levels range from very low (small batteries) to very high (high-voltage power transmission). The DC to DC converters MOSFET is a type of field-effect transistor (FET). It has an insulated gate, whose voltage determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. Gideon Analytical Laboratories received 8 totalMurata Ps DC-DC converters (pn 8600118) in two separate batches. The first batch had a different mode of failure than the second batch. The goal was to determine the cause of the failures by focusing specifically on the MOSFETs.

Failure analysis was conducted on the Murata Ps DC-DC converters. Batch 1 was up first. MOSFETs were unpotted to expose components of interest. It was then electrically tested by lifting the gate and source wires from the circuitry. Two of the MOSFETs had shorted terminals. Another one of the MOSFETs had thermal damage that overwhelmed its junctions with heat, destroying some of its hex cells. The pulse width modulator (PWM) was decapsulated and inspected for damage. There was thermal cracking. The ground rail, which lies at the perimeter, was charred because of too much heat. The gold wire melts around 1.2 amps. The second batch of failures traces on the two PWMs. The PWMs and MOSFETS were quality. Overall, the results are clear from testing the two batches. When the MOSFET fails, the PWM does too. If the MOSFET does not fail, neither does the PWM. These two components are not the cause of the Murata Ps DC-DC Converters (Pn 8600118). Something else is going on in the circuitry that is causing these devices to fail.

At Gideon Analytical Laboratories, we can test individual components within a device to make sure they are functioning properly. In this case, we knew theMurata Ps DC-DC Converters (Pn 8600118) were failing, and as requested, successfully testing and eliminated the MOSFETs as a possible cause. Gideon Analytical Laboratories has the ability to solve almost any electrical problem. We can be comprehensive in our approach, but we can also test individual components. We aim to please the customer. We are here to help companies in the electronics industry solve their problems. We have helped hundreds of companies already. Let us help you too.
