Gideon Analytical Laboratories received several ball grid arrays (BGAs) to specifically look for any shorts, opens, cracks, or contamination issues that were preventing its operation. Radiography analysis was requested.

A BGA is a type of surface-mount packaging (a chip carrier) used for integrated circuits. They come in two basic types: plastic ball grid arrays ([PBGAs)](http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/packaging-databooks/packaging-chapter-14-databook.pdf) and ceramic ball grid arrays ([CBGAs).](http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/package_info/CBGAPRES.pdf)  BGA packages are used to permanently mount devices such as microprocessors. A BGA can provide more interconnection pins than can be put on a dual in-line or flat package. The whole bottom surface of the device can be used, instead of just the perimeter. The leads are also on average shorter than with a perimeter-only type, leading to better performance at high speeds.

Radiography was used to inspect the BGAs. All the ball bonds were examined for alignment and voiding next to the trace line. The little white spots inside the balls are voiding caused by degassing during the soldering process. The red arrow indicates the worst case of voiding on the entire BGA, at 7.3%. Other than this area, there were absolutely no other issues with these BGAs.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories can customize an analysis plan that works specifically for your company. We can also do specialized analysis by request. If you need radiography work, call us for our expertise. If you have any problems with electronics whatsoever do not hesitate to give us a call. From transformers to transistors; from PCBs to power supplies; from contamination to radiography and everywhere in between, Gideon Analytical Laboratories is the place to call.
