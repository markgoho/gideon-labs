This filter is used in a water filter system for water consumption. The filters were plugging up rather fast with the pink material shown in the photograph below.

Since these problem types are unknown, one must choose the appropriate analysis method for material identification. Methods used are Fourier transform [infrared](/analytical-services/fourier-transform-infra-red-spectroscopy/) spectroscopy (FTIR), [X-Ray](/analytical-services/x-ray-diffraction/) Diffraction (XRD) and Gas Chromatography-mass Spectrometry ([GCMS)](/analytical-services/gcms/)) since the filters were designed to filter out organics and inorganics. The FTIR, as well as GCMS, identified the organic portion as cellulose nitrate and the inorganic portion by XRD was identified as a yellow iron oxide hydrate.

Gideon Analytical Labs can identify “unknowns” even when the related field is not in electronics. Our extensive database and experience in the above three areas of FTIR, GCMS, and XRD make analysis possible with over 300,000 spectra and basic interactive chemistry to identify the “unknown materials”. This happens in the field, at suppliers, in the process, and other places. Make chemistry work for you; let Gideon do your analysis. Let's not forget Gideon has the solutions.
