Gideon Analytical Labs received several samples thought to a contain silicone contaminate that prevented adhesion on the metal substrate. The analysis was performed using micro-FTIR analysis for the presence of silicone in three samples.

The samples were first examined under a microscope to identify the FTIR.

The contaminate is a dimethyl siloxane preventing adhesion.
