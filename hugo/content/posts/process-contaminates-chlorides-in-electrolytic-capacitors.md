Gideon Analytical Laboratories received electrolytic capacitors for chloride analysis according to a prior analysis technique for determining the presence of chloride. The chloride analysis technique was developed because chlorine is a known catalytic corrosive element on aluminum.

The analysis was performed using an [SEM-EDS](/analytical-services/scanning-electron-microscopy/) system giving elemental analysis in relation to the intensity of the element at a specific wavelength or energy level (Kev). Since Kev (energy levels) for specific elements do not change, these are used to identify the elements in the sample. One of many SEM-EDS spectra pictures is at the top right. The analysis was performed on the tab, the lead, the fillet, the shank and the stitching where anode foil attaches.

Failure analysis performed by Gideon Analytical Laboratories can help solve problems for a variety of companies that choose to use Gideon’s services. This analysis is used as a quality control tool; it has helped several companies to monitor potential problems from component manufacturing vendors, assembly vendors and processing vendors.

The question becomes how much is the reliability of your products worth to your company? Gideon Analytical Labs can perform many specifications for customer’s needs. Knowledge of how and why a design, manufacturing, process, environmental, or mechanical failures occur can be invaluable information for a variety of companies in the electronics industry.
