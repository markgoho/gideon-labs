Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two transformers from the same manufacturing vintage; one was failed and the other was unused. The transformer is an E-I configuration with a 120v input and 13.45 V output on the secondary. A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. Electromagnetic induction produces an electromotive force within a conductor which is exposed to time-varying magnetic fields. Transformers are used to increase or decrease the alternating voltages in electric power applications. The goal was to determine the cause of the failure and inspect the unused transformer for possible workmanship and material issues that may have caused failures in the field.

We conducted failure analysis of the transformer by a disassembling it and then checking the design, structure, and materials. All the laminations were configured in an E-I pattern. The crimp connection was well secured on both the primary and secondary leads on each end. Several layers of tape and film provided for strain relief and dielectric separation. The electric circuit consists of successive turns of wire on a dielectric square tube. The electric circuit consisted of successive turns of wire on a dielectric square tube. The primary and secondary wires within the transformer were removed and inspected for defects; none of which were found. The failure was extremely charred, which exhibits overheating. The transformer failed as a result of too much current going through the secondary wiring neckdown caused by the manufacturer.

At Gideon Analytical Laboratories, we have the knowledge, experience, and equipment to solve diagnose the cause of any problem with any electrical component. We can diagnose problems with printed circuit boards, capacitors, transistors, resistors, MOSFETs, diodes, voltage regulators, power supplies, Â circuitry, issues with contamination, moisture, fires, and so much more! Whether it involved design, manufacture, or application, we have you covered. Imagine the peace of mind that comes with knowing why your devices are failing and being able to correct that problem. Save time and save money. Give Gideon Analytical Laboratories a call today.
