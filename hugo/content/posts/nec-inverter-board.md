Gideon Analytical Laboratories received three sample NEC 104PW161 power inverter boards for failure analysis. A power inverter is designed to convert direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). Inverters are used to operate all types of electrical equipment that uses batteries. DC current is what batteries store, but most electrical devices need AC current. These NEC104PW161 inverters had an output voltage of 520V and an output current of 5.5mA. The goal was to determine why they were failing.

Electrical tests on each of the three samples were conducted to determine input voltage and current, in addition to other measurables. These electrical tests were conducted on an oscilloscope. There was a fairly large difference between input current consumption across the three samples. The sample with the failed fuse consumes the most power. Clearly, the third sample had a high current draw. There were a number of additional tests that could have been conducted to better understand the causes for high current draw including leakage current checks, lamp current measurements, or operating temperature spot checks. The company decided, however, to discontinue the analysis.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories can help electronics companies better understand why their products are not working. Whether it is a materials compatibility issue, or problems in design, production, or the application, Gideon Analytical Laboratories can solve problems. Failure analysis information provided by Gideon Analytical Laboratories can give companies a chance to correct their problems and ensure their products are reliable.
