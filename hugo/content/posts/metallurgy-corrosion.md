Several screws were presented to Gideon Analytical Labs due to corrosion. The screws were analyzed withÂ [SEM-EDS.](/analytical-services/scanning-electron-microscopy/) The micrograph indicates the spot where this screw was analyzed. Chloride was found on the spot where corrosion was found.

Gideon Analytical Labs can identify the source and cause of corrosion allowing the customer to implement the corrective action immediately.
