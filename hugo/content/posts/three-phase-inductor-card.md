Gideon Analytical Laboratories received two 3-phase inductor cards to be analyzed. [Three](http://www.oempanels.com/what-does-single-and-three-phase-power-mean) Phase power is a three wire Alternating Current (AC) power circuit. Most US commercial buildings use a3 Phase 4 Wire 208Y/120V power arrangement because of its power density and flexibility.Compared to single phase, a 3phase power arrangement provides 1.732 (the square root of 3) times more power with the same current and provides (7) power circuits. [An](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor) inductor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in a magnetic field when an electric current is flowing through it.An inductor typically consists of an electric conductor, such as a wire, that is wound into a coil. When the current flowing through an inductor changes, the time-varying magnetic field induces a voltage in the conductor, described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, the direction of induced electromotive force opposes the change in current that created it. The goal was to determine why these 3-phase inductors were failing.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories immediately got right down to business. The first card had solder that did not cover the barrel properly. The flux had not migrated up the barrel shaft. The wetting was good and there was no graininess found. The second card had several solder joints that were unacceptable, and there were a couple pins that had substantial voids in them. This was also unacceptable. The solder joints and flux voids caused this failure. Gideon uses many standards for determining printed circuit board acceptability and populated assemblies.

Gideon Analytical Laboratories, in usual victorious fashion, solved this case. At Gideon Analytical Laboratories, solving electrical problems is what we do. We have the knowledge and the analytical equipment to get the job done right, and to get the job done fast. Why waste time wondering why your parts are failing? Why waste money by letting them fail? Let Gideon Analytical Laboratories quell your anxiety and get your products back to functioning properly. Don't delay. Call Gideon Analytical Laboratories today.
