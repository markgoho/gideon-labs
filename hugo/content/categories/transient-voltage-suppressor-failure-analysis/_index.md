Transient Voltage Surge Suppressors protect against transient voltage spikes that normally occur in less than one nanosecond (.000000001 second). The most common and inexpensive utilize one or more MOVs (Metal-Oxide Varistor). The effect of the MOV is to clamp the maximum voltage value at a specified level above the peak of the rated RMS voltage. The clamping voltage will increase in a non-linear fashion with an increase in peak surge amperes.
