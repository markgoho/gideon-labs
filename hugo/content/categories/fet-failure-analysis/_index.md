A field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor commonly used for weak-signal amplification (for example, for amplifying wireless signals). It is also a semiconductor device that outputs current in proportion to its input voltage. FETs use a small amount of control current to regulate a larger output current. The device can amplify analog or digital signals. It can also switch DC or function as an oscillator.
