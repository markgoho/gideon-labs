title: Component Failure Analysis
---

Through component failure analysis and failure analysis performed on other levels, we can identify the problem area. Was the failure caused by an application problem? A design problem? A process problem? A mechanical problem? Materials incompatibility? A quality issue associated with component manufacturing? Or is the failure an end of life wear out mechanism? These are questions we answer through failure analysis and component failure analysis.

Gideon Labs performs failure analysis on discrete electrical components: capacitors (film, tantalum, electrolytic, ceramic, disc, polarized, ac, dc, etc.), relays (solid state, mechanical, electromechanical, mercury, current, blind, track) PWB (contamination, ions, IPC 650, cross sections, tin migration, PTH opens), transformers (power, isolation, current, voltage, signal, flyback, oil, pulse, step up and down, high and low voltage, high frequency), resistors, fans, cable, connectors, and semiconductors (diodes, FETs, PWMs, oscillators, thyristers, SCRs, rectifiers, interconnect and packaging problems, etc). The component list is unduly long to mention all the components we have analyzed.
