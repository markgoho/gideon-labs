An Amplifier receives a signal from some pickup transducer or other input source and provides a larger version of the signal to some output device or to another amplifier stage. An input transducer signal is generally small (a few millivolts from a cassette or CD input or a few microvolts from an antenna) and needs to be amplified sufficiently to operate an output device (speaker or other powerhandling device).
