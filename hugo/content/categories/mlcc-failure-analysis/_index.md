MLCC stands for Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors. Ceramic capacitors are vulnerable to cracking because of PCB flexing. They also have a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) difference from the PCB of almost 2. They are also one of the smallest discrete components on the PCB used over overwhelmingly in decoupling application.
