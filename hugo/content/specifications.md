## Specifications and Test Methods for the Electronic Component Industry

Gideon has worked on many specifications over the years both in development and testing. Many of the following are either performed or modified to suit our customers needs and we continue to investigate new specifications like RoHS and WEEE. We have already worked with several companies to ensure their RoHS and WEEE compliance.
