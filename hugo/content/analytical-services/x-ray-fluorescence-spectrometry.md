## Description of Technique

X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) is a nondestructive method for the elemental analysis of solids and liquids using a x-ray beam. The sample is irradiated which causes the emission of fluorescent x-rays to emerge from the sample. The x-rays are collected and displayed in a spectrum with either an energy dispersive or wavelength dispersive detector. The elements in the sample are identified by the wavelengths (qualitative) of the emitted x-rays while the concentrations of the elements are determined by the intensity of those x-rays (quantitative). XRF is a bulk analysis technique with the depth of sample analyzed varying from less than 1mm to 1cm depending on energy of the emitted x-ray and the sample composition. The elemental detection is from sodium to uranium.

## Uses

- Used for bulk quantitative and qualitative elemental analysis on samples of solid, powders, and liquids.
- Quantitative elemental data is given in ppm to weight percentage concentrations. Standards can be generated.
- Qualitative data - elements from boron to uranium
