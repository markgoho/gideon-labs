## Description of Technique

{{< picture src="sims4500" alt="SIMS 4500" >}}
This technique uses a focused primary energetic cesium or oxygen dimer ion beam to erode atoms from a selected region a sample surface. As the energetic primary ion beam sputters the sample surface, secondary ions formed are extracted from the sample and analyzed in a double-focusing mass spectrometer system. The lateral distribution of the ions is maintained through the spectrometer so that the mass resolved image of the secondary ions can be projected onto several types of image detectors.

SIMS has exceptional sensitivity, depth profiling capability, mass range for H to U, and lateral resolution of 1um or less. SIMS is best used for analyzing trace species (dopants and contaminants) in the semiconductor industry.
