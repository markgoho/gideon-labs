## Application

{{< picture src="tg209" alt="thermal analysis" >}}
Thermal analysis is used to characterize materials by measuring physical and reactive properties as a function of temperature. Temperature range becomes one of the most important criteria when considering such applications as the transportation industry, 3rd rail where voltage spikes and current are high for short durations, and electronic equipment exposed to the elements. Matching the materials in electronic packaging, polymer potting, and encapsulation is important to ensure product integrity in these environments.

Thermal analysis (TA) offers the ability to evaluate and compare materials. The information TA provides includes:

- Curing kinetics
- Thermal stability (in different environments)
- Oxidative stability
- Purity
- Degree of cure
- Thermal expansion rates (negative and positive)

### DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry)

Measures heat and temperature of transitions such as Tg, isotherms, crystallization, and melting.

### Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)

Measures weight changes up to 1000°C

### Thermomechanical Analysis (TMA)

Measures dimensional changes. The maximum temperature is 800°C. These techniques can be performed at or below room temperature.

## Sample Information

DSC and TGA samples may be in solid or liquid form. Larger samples may have to be ground or cut into a suitable size. TMA samples must have parallel top and bottom faces, a maximum height 25mm, and a maximum diameter of 9.5mm.

## Information Obtained

- Bulk: measures changes for the entire sample
- Quantitative data (with standards)
- Qualitative data
- Molecular: Organic and Inorganic
- Crystalline Phases: DSC can monitor phase transitions.
- Thermochemical provides information as a function of temperature.
