title: Rigaku X-Ray Diffraction
---

This Rigaku Rotaflex RU-200B micro-XRD is using Canberra Genie 2000 software. It has the following features:

- Integrated data acquisition and analysis Independent support for over 250 detector inputs
- Networking for distributed MCA operation and centralized data management
- Comprehensive and flexible user programming capability
- Compatibility with the full CANBERRA MCA line
- Wide variety of layered software options available for specialized spectroscopy applications
- Compatible with WindowsÂ® 7 64-bit, Windows 7 32-bit, and Windows XP 32-bit operating systems, and also Windows Server 2008 32-bit (SP2) and 64-bit (R2 SP1)
- Multi-language support: English, French, German, and Russian

The front shields were taken off to expose the goniometer. [A more detailed explanation of the software.](http://www.canberra.com/products/radiochemistry_lab/genie-2000-software.asp?Accordion1=6&#fieldpro)

There are six collimators ranging in 100 um to 10 um. The power panel is also included. We also made oxygen-free metal standards from a variety of different metals. We also installed a video adapter which prevents any human contact with the radiation. We have several filaments and metal replacement for the metal on the Position Sensitive Proportional Counter.

All the manuals for the XRD and software are included. In addition, the dongle is there so one can instantly start learning the software. The large silver looking rectangle on the floor is the transformer.

What type of detector does the system use? The goniometer uses a PSPC with P10 gas feed into a pulsed amplifier, time to amplitude converter and then into a digital MCA which then connects to the computer. Can be networked and controlled.

What is the angular range? 150 degrees and positional resolution is .2 degrees FWHM What is the allowable sample size? The unit is a micro XRD. The largest collimator is 1.0mm as defined by the collimators. Does the system have a Euler cradle? Not applicable to goniometer.

Is the Rietveld analysis available? See Canberra Genie 2000 software. Did not see this in their manual. Does the system come with ICDD powder diffraction files? Yes. ICDD powder diffraction file, NIST Crystal Data, Nist/ICDD Electron Diffraction Database What has the system been used for? Crystal structure on aluminum. The system has 60 hours of use and originally cost ðŸ’²235,000 USD.

Does the system come with a pole figure (texture analysis) capabilities? NO

Is a dedicated water supply required? The unit comes with a Neslab Coolflow System II and this needs water. The Nestlab can be regulated by the controls in the back of the unit. The target needs 8liters/min, the tube and HV transformer need 6 liters/min and the TMP needs 1 liter/min. As long as the water is supplied to the Neslab unit, these are easily satisfied.

What are the power requirements? 200V/3 phase/50A /50 or 60 Hz Capacity is 18KVA

Does the software calculate retained austenite? See Canberra Genie 2000 software. [This is the software with the unit.](http://www.canberra.com/products/radiochemistry_lab/genie-2000-software.asp)

Are the x-ray tubes pre-aligned? If not, how much time is required to align the x-ray tube? The X-ray tube is stationary. Whatever option is installed on the unit is aligned to the tube, not the other way around. The x-ray tube has two shutters for two different options. The unit only uses one only for the PSPC goniometer. Once leveled on the plate form, the entire goniometer is mechanically moved away from the shutter with a collimator in place and aligned with a laser which hits the specimen holder. Once this is done the first time, you just change samples. Alignment time is dependent on experience.

Are there any additional stages/attachments that come with the system? NO

Does the software calculate peak widths (FWHM)? You can do this through the MCA, Lynx- digital signal analyzer on any ROI. Also, see Canberra Genie 2000 software. This software was brand new and we never got to use it but can give FWHM as well under calibration.

Does the software calculate grain size? See Canberra Genie 2000 software.

There is a degas switch and a display lamp. The unit has to be pumped down to a minimum of 10-4 Pa and then degassed for 5 minutes to eliminate adsorbed gases on the filament.

Why is Gideon trying to sell a perfectly good XRD? Our business has changed throughout the years. We used this on a particular job and that work went away. We would like to mainstream our business into equipment that is utilized greater than 10%.

How old is this unit? The unit is probably 15 years old with 6o hours on it and the software is currently under win7. Both 32 and 64 bit are loaded on the computer.

How much space does Rigaku recommend for the unit? 5x4 meters We are selling this for a very reasonable price of ðŸ’²15,000 USD.
