title: Rigaku Micro Diffractometer XRD
---

Gideon has a Rigaku (x-ray diffraction) Rotaflex RU-200B series with a PSPC (position sensitive proportional counter) type micro-diffractometer with auxiliary cabinet, H.V. transformer, water circulator a \$3000 item we have thrown in, radiation enclosure, New PC running Â Canberra Gennie 2000 (currently sold software) and a Lynx MCA for x-ray to PC control. This is a 22K upgrade to modernize the system so that it could be networked and run in auto mode. See pictures below.

We have the electrical interface box also. 3 phase 208 volts. We have everything intact because it only has about 13 hours of usage and 62.6 total "on time" hours. It resides in the lab and not in storage because our intent was to put it back into service but things did not work out. This is a dual shutter unit so that two experiments or samples can be run at a time with a multitasking board. This is a research grade instrument. This unit can take many attachments sold via Rigaku and other detectors. Can be used in the silicon chip for defects, inorganic analysis (ICDD, process control, corrosion), polycrystalline molecules with an R-axis detector, phase analysis, research on zeolites and formulation, and drug research to mention a few applications.

We have extra filaments, 10,30,50,100 micron collimators, and all the materials, booklets and apparatus that came with the unit. This unit cost 230K. This is an excellent instrument in an excellent condition unlike resellers on line.

This unit is a rotating anode (Rigaku RU-200B) with a copper source.Â It has two shutters.Â We used only one.Â This unit has aÂ PSPC (enclosed is some verbiage from the manual below) and has the other shutter to install as an option, the Raxis image,Â or many other options you can getÂ from Rigaku.Â This unit is versatile in terms of the available options. Many people, especially at universities, use this unit in the biology field or polymer field with the image Raxis detector. We did not. I have enclosed a picture or two about the PSPC and unit.

### Manual

The Position-Sensitive Proportional Counter system (PSPC system for short) is a rapid counting system for X-ray diffraction. In the case of the conventional system, the counter is made to scan over the required angular measurement range so as to measure counts at the respective angles in sequence. Whereas, this system can perform simultaneous counting of X-rays incident on the sensitive region (angular measurement range) of the proportional counter over the whole range. As a result, the time required for measurement is reduced corresponding to the ratio between the slit width in the conventional method and the length of the sensitive region in this method, that is, by one to two orders of magnitude. In other words, thisÂ system displays such performance as achieved by multiple counters and counting circuits. The PSPC system can find the following applications accordingly.

1. Diffractometry of samples which may be damaged by X-radiation. (In the case that power-up of the X-ray generator is not allowed.)
2. When measurement should be completed in a short time. For example, diffractometry of a sample regarding its transient phenomenon or a sample whose properties will change of themselves in a short time after sample treatment:
3. Drastic reduction of the measurement time (e.g. several tens of hours originally required) when dealing with weak diffraction intensities (diffuse scattering, small-angle scattering, etc.)
4. Drastic reduction of the measurement time when dealing with the diffraction ofÂ aÂ very small amount of sample. Besides, the PSPC system is likely to be applicable to simultaneous spectrometry of multiple elements (chemical analysis).

Incidentally, since the maximum counting rate is limited (approx. 2 x 10<sup>4</sup>Â ps), it is not appropriate to try to use this PSPC system for further reduction of the measurement time about samples having very high diffraction intensities.
